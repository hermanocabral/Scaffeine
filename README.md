Scaffeine
=========

Scaffeine is a collection of modular source code packages packages like blogs, membership, 
commerce, etc that let you quickly compose production-ready, white-label source code solutions.  This is different than projects like
orchard or wordpress in that our focus is on the source code itself... making it easy to use, consume and customize.

Whether you are making a Console Application or a MVC Website, our tools make it possible to never write the same code
twice!

Philosophy
-----
