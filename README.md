Scaffeine
=========

Scaffeine is a starter project template built using ScaffR.

Philosophy
-----
Scaffeine was designed as a very simple, yet powerful, baseline package that allows us to standardize all of our boilerplate code that we typically write for all our projects.
Scaffeine is a competitor to Wordpress, but gives you lower level control of the internal framework giving you, the developer, more power to create the really custom
business logic that your clients are asking for.

Technology
-----
The Scaffeine architecture uses the following frameworks

* ASP.NET MVC
* ScaffR
* Twitter Bootstrap
* JQuery
* Ninject
* MvcSiteMapProvider
* T4Scaffolding
* KnockoutJS
* SignalR
* Entity Framework CodeFirst (w/ migrations)
